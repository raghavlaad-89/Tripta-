I have loaded data from to my own MongoDB database.

 I have made frontend for website which is in frontend folder.
 I have not integrated backend with frontend.
 To run backend:
  npm install
  npm run dev

To run frontend:
  npm install
  npm start

Task is not complete, the stored data is not displayed to frontend. Frontend shows data which is already present in Data.js file. I have not added rating and authentication functionality.
